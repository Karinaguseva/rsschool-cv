**My goal is to learn a new profession, using all the stubbornness that I have.**

Slight knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

```
function showTime() {
    const time = document.querySelector('.time');
    const date = new Date();
    const currentTime = date.toLocaleTimeString();
    time.innerHTML = currentTime;
    setTimeout(showTime, 1000);
    }
showTime();
```
I have no work experience in this profession, I only ended stage0 in RS-school.

I have a higher education in the customs specialty.

English language level B2.
